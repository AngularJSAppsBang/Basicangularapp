<h2>About</h2>
<p>MeetUpMedia provides information technology (IT) systems and services that support MeetUpMedia education, research, and administrative programs. While working to modernize these systems, MeetUpMedia is also collaborating with faculty, staff, and students on innovative IT services to meet the diverse needs of the MeetUpMedia community.</p>

<p>
The focus is now on “platform-based” models designed to create and connect ecosystems of diverse participants as producers and consumers of services. Our goal is to leverage application programming interfaces (APIs) to help faculty create new systems for teaching and research; students to securely create new applications; and staff to feel better supported while also being able to develop applications that address specific needs.</p>

<p>The department’s new operating model, based on agile, iterative experimentation, is central to enabling these IT innovations and improved administrative systems. To find out more about MeetUpMedia transformation and current proof-of-concept projects.
